--------------------------------------

Localizable (EN + RO)
	Each component will check for its name in a loc .xml after initialisation (or before somehow)
	
Import from other types of files
	From doc and xml: 
		Import the xml in a nice and clean way
		Python script that will make a temp *.xml file from the doc and the import the doc
	By Hand:
		modify current *.xml save to contain the new recipe
		
Dump
	Just make a copy of the main *.xml file and place it wherever the user wants

Safety	
	Try to use OneDrive or a cloud save somehow
